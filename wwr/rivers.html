                    people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell

                <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                    undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                    and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
                    good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the 
                    late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river 
                    flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, 
                    and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid 
                    (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence 
                    of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater</p>
