      <h3>Purpose</h3>

We at Web Builder can digitize any store and bring it into the 21st century using our custom-built e-commerce websites. We are in the unique position of being able to open an additional revenue stream while the website itself will be low-cost maintenance. We are more than capable of handling stores of any size.</p>  <!-- change this -->
